🌤️ Weather Web Application (Mini Project)

This is my first mini project built while learning React. It is a simple weather web application that provides current weather information for a selected location. The application is developed using React and styled with Material-UI components, offering a clean and modern user interface.

Key features:

🌡️ Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity.

📱 User-friendly interface with responsive design for different screen sizes.

🌍 Integrates a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

This project helped me get hands-on experience with React, working with APIs, and using Material-UI for design.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
